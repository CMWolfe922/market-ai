      "Coinbase jumps after Wall Street cheers cost-cutting measures, active user numbers\n",
      "Coinbase reported mixed earnings on Thursday that showed a jump in monthly users, even though revenue missed analysts' estimates and the company had a wider-than-anticipated loss during the quarter. The stock jumped more than 6% in premarket trading. Still, analysts remained largely bullish on the cryptocurrency platform, which has been slammed this year as crypto prices have fallen. The stock has lost nearly 78% year to date. \"While Coinbase Global (COIN) today after the market close posted a 3Q22 report that at first glance appeared disappointing, even in the context of a digital asset exchange operating in the midst of a severe 'crypto winter,' upon further review the print offered reasons for relief and perhaps even optimism,\" BTIG analyst Mark Palmer wrote in a Thursday note. Palmer reiterated his buy rating but reduced his price target to $110. Active user jump Where analysts see the potential for optimism in Coinbase's report is in its reported active monthly users. While active monthly users dipped in the quarter to 8.5 million from 9 million, the company handily beat Wall Street's expectations of 7.84 million monthly active users. The full-year guidance of nearly 9 million monthly active users was also better than the Street forecast. \"Institutional trading volume of $133bn was down 43% year-over-year, but beat the consensus estimate of $123.2bn,\" said Palmer, adding, \"while we remain bullish on COIN's long-term prospects, we are reducing our estimates and the multiple we employ to reflect the broader rerating of growth-oriented equities and the uncertain duration of the crypto winter that has weighed heavily on the company's operating performance.\" Cost controls Part of the reason Coinbase beat estimates on an adjusted earnings basis was due to cost controls, which should also help going forward. \"The company is becoming increasingly cost conscious and updating its scenario planning — while still investing for the future — as it is unclear how long the current crypto downturn may persist,\" wrote Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish in a note on Friday. \"While no explicit F23 guidance was provided, management indicated they are planning with a conservative bias, assuming macro headwinds persist and potentially intensify.\" Budish also lowered his price target after management's guidance but maintained his equal weight rating on the Coinbase. JPMorgan analysts noted this as a positive as well. They kept their neutral rating and updated the bank's price target to $66 from $60. \"We continue to be pleasantly surprised by the resiliency of the retail commission,\" Kenneth Worthington wrote in a Friday note. \"Here we note that Coinbase acts as the market maker for retail, giving it a bit more control to manage the explicit and implicit commissions charged. The result was that lower trading volume drove Coinbase trading revenue to the lowest level since becoming a public company.\" Positive catalysts ahead Though near-term growth is likely to be slower, analysts see positive catalysts ahead for Coinbase. \"We continue to view both a U.S. derivatives launch and regulatory clarity as the most significant [near-term] catalysts for trading revenue, and the potential for offshore liquidity moving back to U.S.,\" wrote Cowen analyst Stephen Glagola in a note on Friday. \"In addition, with $5.6B of liquidity ending Q3, we continue to think COIN is well capitalized to execute on product expansion in a multi-year downturn.\" Cowen has an outperform rating on shares of Coinbase and a $75 price target, albeit down from an earlier $85. \"While we are concerned around muted growth in NT staking and trading volumes coupled with an elevated expense outlook, we are excited about the growth in interest income from USDC and staking opportunities following the Shanghai upgrade, targeted for 1H'23,\" wrote Needham analyst John Todaro, also in a Friday note. Needham has a buy rating and an $89 price target on Coinbase. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "After more than two years of a historically lean housing market, listings are starting to rise − and swiftly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active inventory nationally jumped 33.5% in October from the same time last year, according to Realtor.com. That puts supply at the highest level in two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not that sellers are rushing into the market; newly listed homes dropped 16% from a year ago, and pending listings are down 30%. But supply is growing because the homes that are on the market aren't selling as fast as they did just six months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average number of days it takes to sell a home is now 51, up by six days compared with a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As the rapid runup in rates reshapes housing market dynamics this fall, both buyers and sellers are taking a step back to recalibrate their plans,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates have climbed so high and so fast that home shoppers are rushing to the sidelines. Already, affordability was rough with home prices up more than 40% since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. But with rates now more than twice what they were in January, at just over 7%, potential buyers are looking at a monthly payment that is nearly $1,000 higher than it would have been at the start of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing availability varies by city, depending on demand and affordability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Phoenix, inventory jumped a striking 174% in October. The city saw a mad rush of buyers over the past two years as employees who could suddenly work from anywhere moved out of pricey markets in California. Now, sales in the city are down more than 30% from a year ago, according to Redfin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inventory is also up 167% in Raleigh, North Carolina, and up 145% in Nashville, Tennessee, markets that also saw an influx of buyers during the pandemic. Inventory is still down in Chicago, Milwaukee and Hartford, Connecticut, but those markets did not see the same surge in demand over the last two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slowdown in demand for homes has caused sellers to cut their prices. A full 20% of listings now on Realtor.com have had a price reduction − about twice the share as a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, home prices are not exactly falling yet. The price gains from a year ago are, however, shrinking at the fastest pace on record, according to several surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with prices still high, more buyers appear to be widening their searches. Just over 60% of listings views on Realtor.com in the third quarter of this year came from shoppers outside of a listing's area. That's up from 57% in the second quarter and 52% in the same quarter of 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For buyers with the flexibility, relocating to a lower-priced market could help offset higher mortgage costs. There's also a takeaway for sellers in these areas – on a well-priced home, you could still see strong interest from these out-of-towners,\" added Hale.\n",
      "Here are the top Senate races to watch in the 2022 midterms\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle for control of the U.S. Senate could hinge on a single race. A handful of make-or-break Senate elections in key states are only growing more competitive as candidates barrel toward the Nov. 8 midterm elections. Only a few contests could determine how the Senate handles policy — and President Joe Biden's nominees for key posts — for the rest of the president's first term. Republicans have been consistently favored to win control of the House, but the Senate looks like a toss up. In recent months, Democrats had appeared more likely to hold their Senate majority — but in the final week before Election Day, a popular forecast tilted in the GOP's favor. Democrats hold the slimmest possible majority in the Senate, a reality that at times has reined in Biden's most ambitious policy goals. The chamber is split 50-50, and Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote. Biden's presence in the White House could make his party's bid to hold the Senate more difficult: the president's party historically struggles in midterm elections. While Biden's approval rating has climbed from the lowest points of his term, most voters polled still disapprove of the job he is doing as Americans struggle with high inflation, among other issues. Biden's party reshaped its national campaign messaging after the Supreme Court overturned longstanding abortion rights in June. The court's contentious and unpopular ruling seemed to upend the midterms overnight, handing Democrats a powerful tool to stoke turnout among voters outraged at the conservative court and its supporters in government. In another potential boon for Democrats, a handful of Republicans saddled with political baggage, but backed by former President Donald Trump, won their party's primaries over more mainstream alternatives. Democrats in multiple key races now face Republicans with little or no political experience, extreme policy views or scandalous personal lives, all of which could make them less appealing to general-election voters. Of the 34 seats up for grabs in the midterms, here are the ones that could decide Senate control:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennsylvania\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most competitive and closely-watched races of the cycle pits Democratic Lt. Gov. Fetterman against Trump-backed Republican celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz. They are vying for the open Senate seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman, the progressive former mayor of Braddock, has led Oz in the polls even after a May stroke took him off the campaign trail for months. The 6-foot-8 former college football player's towering stature and dressed-down look have aided his campaign's efforts to contrast him from Oz, a multimillionaire TV star whom it has attacked as an out-of-touch elitist and carpetbagger from New Jersey. The Oz campaign, aided by tens of millions of dollars from Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's PAC, has bombarded Fetterman with ads accusing him of being soft on crime. Oz and his staffers have also sowed doubts about Fetterman's health as he recovers from his stroke, and have hammered him for refusing to agree to more debates beyond one 60-minute face-off set for late October. That move may be paying off: While Fetterman still leads Oz, the gap between the two candidates has shrunk considerably in recent weeks, polling averages show.\n",

      "Georgia\n",
      "\n",
      "Incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock appears to be in a tight race with Republican challenger Herschel Walker, a famed former football pro and business owner backed by Trump. Warnock, a Baptist pastor whose special-election victory in 2021 helped Democrats seize a razor-thin Senate majority, is fighting to win a full term representing the swing state. Gaffes and scandals have hampered Walker's run. He first was forced to reveal having more children than he previously acknowledged. Most recently, an ex-girlfriend accused Walker — a staunch abortion opponent — of paying for her abortion in 2009 and pressuring her to get another two years later. Walker has denied the allegation. Polling averages of the race nevertheless show the two candidates neck and neck, with Warnock holding a slight lead. National political dynamics could be playing an outsize role. Though Biden narrowly beat Trump in the Peach State in 2020, a Monmouth University poll conducted in September showed Georgia voters viewed Trump and the Republican Party more favorably than Walker, whereas Warnock scored higher than Biden and the Democratic Party.\n",

      "Arizona\n",
      "\n",
      "Polls suggest Arizona's Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is poised to fend off a challenge from Republican Blake Masters, a venture capitalist backed by billionaire political activist Peter Thiel. Masters, also backed by Trump, has struggled to gain a competitive footing in the swing state that Biden narrowly won in 2020. As a primary candidate, Masters echoed Trump's false claims of a rigged 2020 election and took a vocal anti-abortion stance, but he has downplayed those views in the general election. He has sought to puncture Kelly's moderate campaign messaging and tie him to Biden, who is unpopular in Arizona. The incumbent Sen. Kelly, a former astronaut and husband of retired Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, has labeled Masters a dangerous radical. Kelly has far outraised Masters: The incumbent's campaign has taken in over $52 million and held nearly $25 million in cash on hand as of mid-July, while Masters' campaign held about $1.5 million in late September, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Thiel, Masters' largest outside donor who spent $15 million on the GOP candidate before the primary election, has not donated to the PAC backing Masters during the general.\n",

Cortez Masto, the state's first Latina senator, has outraised and outspent her opponent. She has also received more support from PACs and other outside groups. The Nevada election is the second-most-expensive Senate fight in the nation, trailing only the Georgia race, according to ad-tracker AdImpact. But polling averages show Cortez Masto in a virtual dead heat with Laxalt, the former state attorney general backed by Trump. Laxalt has pushed a tough-on-crime campaign message and picked up endorsements from police organizations, while echoing Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and his false claims about election fraud in 2020. Cortez Masto, who served two terms as Nevada AG before Laxalt, has also netted support from police groups.\n",

      "North Carolina\n",
      "\n",
      "The race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina hasn't drummed up the same level of publicity – or spending – as some of the flashier marquee Senate fights. But GOP Rep. Ted Budd and Democrat Cheri Beasley are locked in a tight contest that could shape the final Senate map. Beasley, the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, is taking on Budd, a Trump-backed three-term congressman with a staunchly conservative record. The two are running side-by-side in the polls. Still, some see the Tar Heel State, which has not elected a Democratic senator since 2008, as more favorable terrain for the Republican. Budd's record has skewed more conservative than his would-be Senate colleague, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, on key issues such as gun reform and same-sex marriage. Beasley, meanwhile, has kept some distance between herself and Biden, saying at a recent debate that his administration could do more to fight inflation. The two candidates have also clashed over abortion rights. Campaign finance records show Beasley's campaign has outraised Budd's. Her campaign reportedly raised a $13.3 million haul in the third quarter, nearly doubling its second-quarter fundraising. But the McConnell-linked Senate Leadership Fund PAC has spent more than $20 million opposing her. The Senate Majority PAC, aligned with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in mid-October that it will put $4 million more into the North Carolina race, bringing its total spending to $10.5 million.\n",

      "Democrats see Republican Sen. Ron Johnson as a vulnerable incumbent. But the two-term Wisconsin senator nevertheless appears to be gaining momentum against his Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. The 67-year-old Johnson has scored negative approval ratings in recent polls. He has come under fire for repeatedly sowing doubts about Covid-19 vaccines, downplaying the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and being linked to an alleged \"fake electors\" scheme to challenge the 2020 election results, among other controversies. Barnes, who at 35 is just over half Johnson's age, would become Wisconsin's first Black senator if elected. Johnson's campaign has slammed his opponent as being too far left for the Badger State — especially on crime, a main feature of the GOP playbook. Barnes has espoused progressive views in office, but his Senate campaign has focused more on pocketbook issues such as inflation and taxes. Johnson is the only Republican senator running for reelection in a state that Biden won in 2020. But polling averages as of late September show Johnson pulling ahead of Barnes.\n",

Vance and Ryan, both Ohio natives, are competing for the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman. Ryan, who ran a failed presidential bid in the 2020, has campaigned on economic issues and touted his connections to the state, while tarring Vance as a \"San Francisco fraud.\" Ryan has also slammed Vance over his stance on abortion, a top concern among Democratic voters. Vance, the author of the memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" has portrayed himself as a political outsider with a populist message. His campaign has sought to define Ryan as an extension of Biden and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Vance is also a venture capitalist linked to Peter Thiel. The billionaire conservative activist boost Vance's winning primary campaign with $15 million in multiple donations to the super PAC Protect Ohio Values.

But she holds advantages over her Republican opponent, Don Bolduc, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general who has garnered praise from Trump. Bolduc had echoed Trump's false claims of a rigged 2020 election, but reversed himself right after his primary win, saying he had concluded that the election was not stolen after \"a lot of research.\" The New Hampshire primary was held Sept. 13, making it one of the latest nominating contests in the country.

      "Jobs growth came in better than expected in October thanks in part to strong gains in the manufacturing, health-care, and professional and business services sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing jobs increased by 32,000 last month, boosted by gains in the durable goods industry, according to the Labor Department. That advance brought the sector's average monthly job gain for the year to 37,000, compared with 30,000 per month in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some market participants found the increase notable given the sharp slowdown in goods spending in the economy this year, as consumers shift more of their spending to services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The manufacturing gain of 32,000 suggest the economy is far from slowing in a meaningful way,\" TradeStation Group's David Russell wrote in a Friday note.\n",
      "\n",
      "The health-care and social assistance sector also enjoyed strong gains, adding 71,100 jobs last month. By itself, the health-care sector gained 53,000 jobs in October, boosted by growth in ambulatory health-care services, as well as nursing and residential-care facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Labor Department, employment in health care has risen by an average 47,000 per month so far in 2022, outpacing the 9,000 jobs gains posted per month last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People delayed a lot of procedures because of Covid for the last couple of years, so hip replacements and things that were somewhat optional,\" said Horizon Investments' CIO Scott Ladner. \"We're starting to see a surge of those procedures come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leisure and hospitality employment, meanwhile, continued its upward trend, adding 35,000 jobs in October. Jobs growth in the sector was mainly driven by an increase in accommodation jobs, which added 20,000 last month. Positions in restaurants and drinking establishments remained little changed, up 6,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sector is still down by 1.1 million jobs, or 6.5%, from its pre-pandemic level, according to the Labor Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional and business services also was a standout sector, adding 39,000 jobs in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several sectors lagged those areas in the October jobs report, however. Financial activities gained just 3,000, as employment in the sector has \"changed little\" over the past six months, the Labor Department said. Construction added just 1,000 jobs in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retail trade sector was also little changed heading into the holiday season, adding just 7,200 jobs.\n",
      "U.S. payrolls surged by 261,000 in October, better than expected as hiring remains strong\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "Job growth was stronger than expected in October despite Federal Reserve interest rate increases aimed at slowing what is still a relatively strong labor market. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 261,000 for the month while the unemployment rate moved higher to 3.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday. Those payroll numbers were better than the Dow Jones estimate for 205,000 more jobs, but worse than the 3.5% estimate for the unemployment rate. Although the number was better than expected, it still marked the slowest pace of job gains since December 2020. Stocks rose following the nonfarm payrolls release, while Treasury yields also were higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Average hourly earnings grew 4.7% from a year ago and 0.4% for the month, indicating that wage growth is still likely to serve as a price pressure as worker pay is still well short of the rate of inflation. The yearly growth met expectations while the monthly gain was slightly ahead of the 0.3% estimate. \"There has been some signs of cooling. Bur are seeing a pretty strong labor market,\" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"We did see a substantial increase in jobs. But there's been a slowdown in the rate of increase. You would expect that as we get closer to full employment.\" Market pricing shifted slightly toward a 0.5 percentage point Fed rate hike in December, which would be less aggressive than the pace that began in June with 0.75 percentage point moves at each meeting. Traders expect the Fed to enact another 0.5 percentage point increase in February.\n",

      "Health care biggest growth area\n",
      "\n",
      "Health care led job gains, adding 53,000 positions, while professional and technical services contributed 43,000, and manufacturing grew by 32,000. Leisure and hospitality also posted solid growth, up 35,000 jobs, though the pace of increases has slowed considerably from the gains posted in 2021. The group, which includes hotel, restaurant and bar jobs along with related sectors, is averaging gains of 78,000 a month this year, compared with 196,000 last year. Heading into the holiday shopping season, retail posted only a modest gain of 7,200 jobs. Wholesale trade added 15,000, while transportation and warehousing was up 8,000.\n",

      "\"Job gains were fairly widespread, and overall wage gains are still too high,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street. \"So, steady as she goes from a Fed perspective, but incrementally, there's reason to have a little hope that we're starting to see some of the froth come out of the [jobs] market.\" The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage point even though the labor force participation rate declined by one-tenth of a point to 62.2%. An alternative measure of unemployment, which includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons, also edged higher to 6.8%. September's jobs number was revised higher, to 315,000, an increase of 52,000 from the original estimate. August's number moved lower by 23,000 to 292,000. The new figures come as the Fed is on a campaign to bring down inflation running at an annual rate of 8.2%, according to one government gauge. Earlier this week, the central bank approved its fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase, taking benchmark borrowing rates to a range of 3.75%-4%.\n",

      "Theodore Farnsworth, 60, former CEO of Helios & Matheson, and Mitchell Lowe, 70, former CEO of MoviePass, are charged with misleading investors and making false statements about the movie subscription service to boost the stock price of its parent company, Helios & Matheson Analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indictment alleges that Farnsworth and Lowe in 2017, while describing the company's $9.95 \"unlimited\" movie plan as thoroughly tested, sustainable and profitable, were aware that MoviePass's offer was a marketing gimmick and that its parent company did not possess the technology or capability to monetize subscriber data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor had the company done the rigorous marketing testing that it claimed to have completed, the Justice Department said.\n",
      "\n",
      "MoviePass skyrocketed to popularity in 2017 because of its seemingly too-good-to-be-true unlimited movie pass that initially offered customers one movie voucher per day for $30 to $40 a month. The hope was that most subscribers wouldn't actually use the service regularly, in the same way that gyms are able to offset cheap monthly fees because of no-show subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, many MoviePass subscribers began to use the service too frequently and the company started to lose money quickly. In an effort to stay afloat, MoviePass began limiting the number of titles available among other restrictions. The service underwent several iterations of price and offerings before shuttering.\n",

      "Without the backing of movie theaters, which had balked at MoviePass' business model and intrusion into the industry, the company was forced to dismantle in September 2019.\n",

      "Co-founder Stacy Spikes regained ownership of the company in late 2021, but a new version of MoviePass has yet to make its official debut. The company is currently planning beta tests in several cities including Chicago. The expectation is that the new subscription will offer three pricing tiers for $10, $20 and $30, respectively, with each level having a certain number of credits that can be used towards redeeming movie tickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lowe and Farnsworth do not appear to be connected to the new iteration of MoviePass.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the DOJ document, the pair also allegedly knew that the price of MoviePass' unlimited plan would not be enough to offset losses. The plan was to grow new subscribers, inflate Helios & Matheson's stock and attract new investors, the indictment said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news of the indictment comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission in September accused Lowe, Farnsworth and another former MoviePass executive, Khalid Itum, of making false statements and falsifying records.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The indictment repeats the same allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Commission's recent complaint filed on September 27th against Mr. Farnsworth, concerning matters that were publicly disclosed nearly three years ago and widely reported by the news media,\" said Chris Bond, a spokesman for Farnsworth in a statement. \"As with the SEC filing, Mr. Farnsworth is confident that the facts will demonstrate that he has acted in good faith, and his legal team intends to contest the allegations in the indictment until his vindication is achieved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Representatives for Lowe did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, the Justice Department said Farnsworth and Lowe are alleged to have falsely claimed that the number of tickets MoviePass subscribers were purchasing as part of their subscription was declining over time.

      "Cat Clifford, CNBC climate tech and innovation reporter, at Helion Energy on October 20. Photo taken by Jessie Barton, communications for Helion Energy, with Cat Clifford's camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Thursday, October 20, I took a reporting trip to Everett, Wash., to visit Helion Energy, a fusion startup that has raised raised nearly $600 million from a slew of relatively well known Silicon Valley investors, including Peter Thiel and Sam Altman. It's got another $1.7 billion in commitments if it hits certain performance targets. Because nuclear fusion has the potential to make limitless quantities of clean energy without generating any long-lasting nuclear waste, it's often called the \"holy grail\" of clean energy. The holy grail remains elusive, however, because recreating fusion on earth in a way that generates more energy that is required to ignite the reaction and can be sustained for an extended period of time has so far remained unattainable. If we could only manage to commercialize fusion here on earth and at scale, all our energy woes would be solved, fusion proponents say. Fusion has also been on the horizon for decades, just out of reach, seemingly firmly entrenched in a techno-utopia that exists only in science fiction fantasy novels.\n",

      "\n",
      "But visiting Helion Energy's enormous workspace and lab pulled the idea of fusion out of the completely fantastical and into the potentially real for me. Of course, \"potentially real\" doesn't mean that fusion will be a commercially viable energy source powering your home and my computer next year. But it no longer feels like flying a spaceship to Pluto. As I walked through the massive Helion Energy buildings in Everett, one fully operational and one still under construction, I was struck by how workaday everything looked. Construction equipment, machinery, power cords, workbenches, and countless spaceship-looking component parts are everywhere. Plans are being executed. Wildly foreign-looking machines are being constructed and tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Helion Energy building under construction to house their next generation fusion machine. The smokey atmosphere is visible. Photo courtesy Cat Clifford, CNBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the employees of Helion Energy, building a fusion device is their job. Going to the office every day means putting part A into Part B and into part C, fiddling with those parts, testing them, and then putting them with more parts, testing those, taking those parts apart maybe when something doesn't work right, and then putting it back together again until it does. And then moving to Part D and Part E. The date of my visit is relevant to this story, too, because it added a second layer of strange-becomes-real to my reporting trip. On October 20, the Seattle Everett region was blanketed in dangerous levels of wildfire smoke. The air quality index for Everett was 254, making it the worst air quality in the world at that time, according to IQAir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helion Energy's building under construction to house the seventh generation fusion machine on a day when wildfire smoke was not restricting visibility. Photo courtesy Helion Energy\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Several wildfires burning in the north Cascades were fueled by warm, dry, and windy weather conditions. Easterly winds flared the fires as well as drove the resulting smoke westwards towards Everett and the Seattle region,\" Christi Chester Schroeder, the Air Quality Science Manager at IQAir North America, told me. Global warming is helping to fuel those fires, Denise L. Mauzerall, a professor of environmental engineering and international affairs at Princeton, told me. \"Climate change has contributed to the high temperatures and dry conditions that have prevailed in the Pacific Northwest this year,\" Mauzerall said. \"These weather conditions, exacerbated by climate change, have increased the likelihood and severity of the fires which are responsible for the extremely poor air quality.\" It was so bad that Helion had told all of its employees to stay home for the first time ever. Management deemed it too dangerous to ask them to leave their houses. The circumstances of my visit set up an uncomfortable battle. On the one hand, I had a newfound sense of hope about the possibility of fusion energy. At same time, I was wrestling internally with a deep sense of dread about the state of the world. I wasn't alone in feeling the weight of the moment. \"It is very unusual,\" Chris Pihl, a co-founder and the chief technology officer at Helion, said about the smoke. Pihl has worked on fusion for nearly two decades now. He's seen it evolve from the realm of physicist academics to a field followed closely by reporters and collecting billions in investments. People working on fusion have become the cool kids, the underdog heroes. As we collectively blow past any realistic hope of staying within the targeted 1.5 degrees of warming and as global energy demand continues to rise, fusion is the home run that sometimes feels like the only solution. \"It's less of a academic pursuit, an altruistic pursuit, and it's turning into more of a survival game at this point I think, with the way things are going,\" Pihl told me, as we sat in the empty Helion offices looking out at a wall of gray smoke. \"So it's necessary. And I am glad it is getting attention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How Helion's technology works\n",
      "\n",
      "CEO and co-founder David Kirtley walked me around the vast lab space where Helion is working on constructing components for its seventh-generation system, Polaris. Each generation has proven out some combination of the physics and engineering that is needed to bring Helion's specific approach to fusion to fruition. The sixth-generation prototype, Trenta, was completed in 2020 and proved able to reach 100 million degrees Celsius, a key milestone for proving out Helion's approach. Polaris is meant to prove, among other things, that it can achieve net electricity -- that is, to generate more than it consumes -- and it's already begun designing its eighth generation system, which will be its first commercial grade system. The goal is to demonstrate Helion can make electricity from fusion by 2024 and to have power on the grid by the end of the decade, Kirtley told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cat Clifford, CNBC climate tech and innovation reporter, at Helion Energy on October 20. Polaris, Helion's seventh prototype, will be housed here. Photo taken by Jessie Barton, communications for Helion Energy, with Cat Clifford's camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the feasibility of getting fusion energy to the electricity grid in the United States depends on factors Helion can't control -- establishing regulatory processes with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and licensing processes to get required grid interconnect approvals, a process which Kirtley has been told can range from a few years to as much as ten years. Because there are so many regulatory hurdles necessary to get fusion hooked into the grid, Kirtley said he expects their first paying customers are likely to be private customers, like technology companies that have power hungry data centers, for example. Working with utility companies will take longer. One part of the Polaris system that looks perhaps the most otherworldly for a non fusion expert (like me) the Polaris Injector Test, which is how the fuel for the fusion reactor will get into the device. Arguably the best-known fusion method involves a tokamak, a donut-shaped device that uses super powerful magnets to hold the plasma where the fusion reaction can occur. An international collaborative fusion project, called ITER (\"the way\" in Latin), is building a massive tokamak in Southern France to prove the viability of fusion. Helion is not building a tokamak. It is building a long narrow device called a Field Reversed Configuration, or FRC, and the next version will be about 60 feet long. The fuel is injected in short tiny bursts at both ends of the device and an electric current flowing in a loop confines the plasma. The magnets fire sequentially in pulses, sending the plasmas at both ends shooting towards each other at a velocity greater than one million miles per hour. The plasmas smash into each other in the central fusion chamber where they merge to become a superhot dense plasma that reaches 100 million degrees Celsius. This is where fusion occurs, generating new energy. The magnetic coils that facilitate the plasma compression also recover the energy that is generated. Some of that energy is recycled and used to recharge the capacitors that originally powered the reaction. The additional extra energy is electricity that can be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the Polaris Injector Test, where Helion Energy is building a component piece of the seventh generation fusion machine. There will be one of these on each side of the fusion device and this is where the fuel will get into the machine. Photo courtesy Cat Clifford, CNBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kirtley compares the pulsing of their fusion machine to a piston. \"You compress your fuel, it burns very hot and very intensely, but only for a little bit. And the amount of heat released in that little pulse is more than a large bonfire that's on all the time,\" he told me. \"And because it's a pulse, because it's just one little high intensity pulse, you can make those engines much more compact, much smaller,\" which is important for keeping costs down. The idea is actually not new. It was theorized in the 1950s and 60s, Kirtley said. But it was not possible to execute until modern transistors and semiconductors were developed. Both Pihl and Kirtley looked at fusion earlier in their careers and weren't convinced it was economically viable until they came to this FRC design. Another moat to cross: This design does use a fuel that is very rare. The fuel for Helion's approach is deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen that is fairly easy to find, and helium three, which is a very rare type of helium with one extra neutron. \"We used to have to say that you had to go into outer space to get helium three because it was so rare,\" Kritley said. To enable their fusion machine to be scaled up, Helion is also developing a way to make helium three with fusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dose of hope\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no question that Helion has a lot of steps and processes and regulatory hurdles before it can bring unlimited clean energy to the world, as it aims to do. But the way it feels to walk around an enormous wide-open lab facility -- with some of the largest ceiling fans I have ever seen -- it seems possible in a way that I hadn't ever felt before. Walking back out into the smoke that day, I was so grateful to have that dose of hope. But most people were not touring the Helion Energy lab on that day. Most people were sitting stuck inside, or putting themselves at risk outside, unable to see the horizon, unable to see a future where building a fusion machine is a job that is being executed like a mechanic working in a garage. I asked Kirtley about the battling feeling I had of despair at the smoke and hope at the fusion parts being assembled. \"The cognitive dissonance of sometimes what we see out in the world, and what we get to build here is pretty extreme,\" Kirtley said. \"Twenty years ago, we were less optimistic about fusion.\" But now, his eyes glow as he walks me around the lab. \"I get very excited. I get very — you can tell — I get very energized.\" Other young scientists are also excited about fusion too. At the beginning of the week when I visited, Kirtley was at the American Physics Society Department of Plasma Physics conference giving a talk. \"At the end of my talk, I walked out and there were 30 or 40 people that came with me, and in the hallway, we just talked for an hour and a half about the industry,\" he said. \"The excitement was huge. And a lot of it was with younger engineers and scientists that are either grad students or postdocs, or in the first 10 years of their career, that are really excited about what private industry is doing.\"\n",

      "The Fed, earnings, jobs and China: How we think about this week's deluge of data\n",
      "All the major averages closed lower for the week as investors digested another batch of earnings, the Federal Reserve turned hawkish after another rate hike, and new data shows the job market remains stubbornly resilient. While the rate hike was expected, some of the more overly optimistic investors had been hoping for a more dovish tone from the Fed. The statement released by the central bank did provide some hope for a pivot in the near future, but Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday quickly put that notion to bed, with the Fed chair saying \"it is very premature to be thinking about pausing.\" He added: \"People when they hear 'lags' think about a pause. It is very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hikes. We have a ways to go.\" Friday's nonfarm payroll report may drive home Powell's point as we added more jobs than expected in October, though the unemployment rate did tick higher — a positive from the Fed's perspective. We also got a bit of a market rebound on Friday following news that China could finally be ready to allow the use of BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for foreigners, providing optimism that the government will one day allow use of Western MRNA vaccinations for its citizens. The news sent those stocks reliant on China for growth — Starbucks, Estee Lauder and Wynn Resorts, among many others — higher. It also pushed oil prices higher since China coming fully back online would result in more demand for a commodity that remains supply constrained. If China does reopen while Russia remains at war with Ukraine, it could prove something of a double-edged sword: good for companies with exposure to Chinese markets; bad for tamping down inflation, as China would represent a major buyer coming back into the oil market to move prices higher. (It would, however, help energy stocks.) It illustrates what a dynamic, interconnected environment we're trying to navigate. Bad news could be good news. For example, economic weakness means the Fed is further along in its battle against inflation. Or bad news could just be bad news if weak data signals a recession ahead. And good news could be good news: for example, if China reopens and U.S. companies exposed to the region see a boost in demand. Finally, good news could be bad news if it means a second wind for inflation. Following all that? In the end, while we always do our best to steer through this incredibly dynamic market, the one conclusion we feel certain of is maintaining a balanced, well-diversified portfolio. Though nothing is bulletproof, especially in market that is seeing stocks and bonds decline at the same time — along with buying power — a well-rounded portfolio will allow you to realize profits as sectors come into favor. It will also help you redeploy funds into names that have gotten too beaten down, despite a bright longer-term outlook once the current headwinds turn to tailwinds.

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index remains around the 110 level. Gold advanced to around the $1,680 per ounce level. WTI crude prices advanced back to the low-$90s following news that China will allow BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine for foreigners and the yield on the 10-year Treasury is holding at about 4.2%. Looking back This week we received earnings results from Eli Lilly (LLY), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Devon Energy (DVN), Humana (HUM), Estee Lauder (EL), Qualcomm (QCOM), Bausch Health Companies (BHC), Starbucks (SBUX) and Coterra Energy (CTRA). In macroeconomic news, on Tuesday the ISM Manufacturing index came in at 50.2% for the month of October, slightly ahead of estimates of 50%. For those unfamiliar with the index, a reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding, whereas a reading below 50% indicates that it is contracting. On Wednesday, payroll processing firm ADP reported that companies added 239,000 positions in October, ahead of the 195,000 estimate. Also on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve hiked the overnight rate by 75 basis points, a move in line with expectations. On Thursday, initial jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 29 came in at 217,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the prior week and below expectations of 220,000. Also Thursday, the ISM Services index came in at 54.4%, below expectations of 55.2%. We also received factory orders on Thursday, which pointed to a 0.3% monthly advance in September, in line with expectations. Finally, on Friday, we learned that nonfarm payrolls grew by 261,000 in October, better than the 205,000 estimate.

      "The $1.6 billion Powerball jackpot is now the largest ever—here are the top 5 so far\n",
      "Once again, a lottery jackpot has crossed the billion-dollar threshold — the fifth time in the past five years — and this one is a world record. Saturday's Powerball drawing now has a jackpot of $1.6 billion, the largest ever, after no winners were announced for Wednesday night's $1.2 billion drawing. The prize has been growing for more than three months. The odds of winning it are currently roughly one in 292.2 million, according to Powerball. The last Powerball jackpot winner came from the $206.9 million August 3 drawing — nothing to sneeze at, but a mere fraction of the current jackpot, which would top the previous record U.S. jackpot set in January 2016. That one was also a Powerball drawing that reached $1.586 billion and was split between three winning tickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lottery winners choose between receiving their winnings in an annuity — with payments over 30 years — or the more popular option, a single lump sum payment in a smaller amount. (That's the option \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary says you should choose.) The lump sum payment for a Powerball player on Saturday would be $782.4 million. Here's a look at the top lottery prizes ever won so far.\n",

      "This Powerball drawing from Jan. 13, 2016, for which three winning tickets were sold, remains history's biggest lottery prize — but not for much longer. As soon as the current Powerball jackpot finds a winner, or winners, this one from five years ago will drop down to the second-biggest slot. The winners — John and Lisa Robinson in Tennessee, Maureen Smith and David Kaltschmidt in Florida, and Marvin and Mae Acosta in California — split the full prize, giving them the option of roughly $533 million before taxes as an annuity or $327.8 million as the lump-sum payment. The Robinsons' winning ticket was one of four they bought at a grocery store, they told NBC's TODAY show. They opted to take the lump sum. \"We're not guaranteed tomorrow,\" says John. Florida-based Smith and Kaltschmidt also picked the lump sum. At the time they planned to get massages, upgrade their truck and retire with the newfound wealth, according to NBC. The Acostas remained anonymous for months after winning but released a statement saying they were thankful for the \"rare gift that has been placed in our care.\"\n",

      "The winner of this huge drawing in October 2018 also took their time to surface. South Carolina is one of a handful of states that allows lottery winners to claim their prize anonymously, so the ticket-holder — who didn't make themselves known — finally claimed their winnings in March of the following year, just a little more than a month ahead of the deadline to come forward or risk forfeiting the prize. What we do know is that the winner chose the cash option for their prize, taking a one-time payment of roughly $878 million. It's not a record jackpot, that number still represents the biggest payout to a single lottery winner in U.S. history. Based on the expected tax bill, the total haul from that jackpot was likely somewhere around $491.7 million, after both federal and state taxes — a 7 percent income tax in South Carolina, plus the 37 percent federal rate. Other taxes may have also applied.\n",

All we know about the winning player, or players, is that they bought the lucky ticket at Speedway convenience store in Des Plaines, Illinois and they opted to take the lump sum payment option of more than $780 million, according to Mega Millions. Illinois allows lottery winners to remain anonymous, and whoever won this huge prize has chosen to remain unknown to the public.\n",

But because the winning ticket was bought in Michigan, another state that allows winners to remain anonymous, it took a few months for the public to learn anything about the winners. The ticket was reportedly purchased by four members of a lottery club in the Detroit suburb of Novi. A lawyer representing the club claimed the prize for them in March 2021. \"A club member saw a sign that the jackpot was up to $1 billion and remembered that they hadn't bought their tickets yet, so they pulled into the Kroger,\" Kurt Panouses, the estate lawyer and club representative, told reporters on behalf of the winners last year. \"When you play, of course you dream of winning, but the reality of it has been incredible,\" he said. \"This kind of money will impact the families of our club members for generations to come.

      "In the Southeastern U.S., about 20% of respiratory samples are testing positive for a strain of flu called H3N2 that has been associated with more severe illness in children and older people in the past, Romero said.

      "Midterms could be a positive catalyst for stocks as investors await next big inflation report\n",
      "There are two big hurdles for markets in the week ahead - another potentially hot consumer inflation report and the Congressional midterm elections. Stocks were higher Friday but closed out a rough week with losses, after tough talk on interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Wednesday. Powell suggested the central bank may have to raise rates even more than it expected in order to squash inflation, so that makes Thursday's report of the October consumer price index even more critical. At stake in Tuesday's election is control of Congress and that could decide how money is spent and how much is spent on different programs. \"The most important thing for the market to know is that the election is over,\" said Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James. \"100% of the time, the S & P 500 has been up 12 months after the midterm election.\" The House is currently controlled by Democrats, and Democrats have a majority when considering the tie breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris in the Senate. \"We anticipate the most likely outcome is a Republican House of Representatives,\" said Mills. \"The Senate is close. I think the Republicans have the edge right now, but I don't think we really know.\" Midterm rallies Stocks tend to gain in the final months of midterm election years, and strategists have been expecting the market to move higher. The jump in interest rates has been putting a chokehold on growth and tech stocks. The 2-year Treasury yield has been racing higher and briefly touched a 15-year high of 4.8%, following Friday's stronger than expected October jobs report. The S & P 500 rose 1.4% Friday but ended the week at 3,770 with a 3.4% loss. The Nasdaq fell 5.7% for the week but gained 1.3% Friday. \"There will absolutely be a relief rally if results are clear,\" said Julian Emanuel, head of equity, derivative and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI. Emanuel said rumors that China will lift Covid restrictions were helping stocks and sending commodities higher Friday, and that could also be a catalyst in the week ahead if there is actual news that confirms the speculation. \"If the results [of the election] are not clear but not heavily disputed, the positive news potentially coming out of China will be sufficent to help that post midterm rally,\" he said. \"The market sentiment is quite overwhelming in our view such that there's likely to be a bigger rally if Republicans do win.\" CFRA Chief Market Strategist Sam Stovall said even when interest rates are climbing, the midterm election has been a catalyst for stocks. He examined market performance in other midterm election years when interest rates were going up. \"The market was up an average 12.8% 12 months later,\" said Stovall. The years where that occurred were 1946, 1958, 1994 and 2018. \"Even a rising rate environment has not derailed the impact of the post midterm optimism,\" he said. According to CFRA, sectors that perform best from Nov. 1 of a midterm election year to the following Nov. 1 include semiconductor eqipment, up an average 48.2% in that period since 1990. Footwear also does well, up about 42%, as is electronic equipment and instruments. In those years, the S & P has added an average 16% in that period, while the Nasdaq has gained 32.6%. Besides the election, the corporate earnings season continues. Reports are expected from dozens of companies, including Walt Disney, AstraZeneca, Dupont, Wendy's and Occidental Petroleum. Hot inflation? The CPI is by far the most important economic report expected in the coming week, and economists expect consumer inflation rose at an annual pace of 7.9% in October. When excluding food and energy, core CPI is expected to rise at a 6.5% rate, according to Dow Jones. In September, headline CPI was up 8.2%. \"If it comes in below 8% that would be a psychological positive,\" said Stovall. Friday's October employment report was stronger-than-expected with 261,000 jobs added in October, while economists expected 205,000. The strong labor market is seen as a source of inflation by the Fed and so far its rate hikes are not slowing job growth that much. If inflation data were to surprise to the downside, it would be counter to recent trends and be a potential positive catalyst for the market.

      "This week's best performers include Boeing and a casino stock expected to rise another 20%\n",
      "Some of the biggest winners amid the volatile stock market action this week include a health-care name that is being bought, two casino names and Boeing. Stocks were on pace for weekly declines as investors digested the latest Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and comments from Chair Jerome Powell about future tightening. Stronger-than-expected jobs data further fueled concerns that the central bank will stay the course. What follows are companies that outperformed this week and where analysts stand on the stocks. To find these names, CNBC Pro screened for S & P 500 stocks with the best week-to-date gains. Abiomed has the largest gain of 44.9% thanks to news earlier this week that it is being bought by Johnson & Johnson in a $16.6 billion deal . J & J agreed to pay $380 per Abiomed share, a 50.7% premium over Monday's closing price of $252.08. In addition, shareholders of Abiomed shareholders have the right to receive up to $35 per share in cash if certain clinical and commercial milestones are achieved. The next biggest winner was Wynn Resorts , which rallied almost 20% so far this week. Analysts also see the stock gaining another 20%, based on the average price target. Earlier this week, a filing showed that billionaire investor Tilman Fertitta has taken a 6.1% stake in the company. Las Vegas Sands also gained this week, up 8%. Another name in the news this week was Boeing . During its first public investor meeting since 2016, the company forecasted a jump in aircraft deliveries and higher free cash flow next year. Shares are down more than 20% year to date, but gained 10% this week. Boeing has nearly 20% upside to the average analyst price target, according to FactSet. EOG Resources rallied more than 8% so far this week. The energy company, one of three on the list, fell short of earnings expectations when it reported Thursday. However, it also announced a 395,000 net acre position in the Ohio Utica Shale. EOG also increased its regular dividend by 10% to 82.5 cents per share and declared a special dividend of $1.50 per share. The stock has 4% upside to the average analyst price target, according to FactSet. Hologic also gained more than 8% week to date. The medical equipment maker posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and issued an upbeat outlook on Tuesday. The stock is only down nearly 3% so far this year and has 7% upside, according to FactSet.\n",
      "New hope China may soften on Covid boosts our stocks most tied to world's No. 2 economy\n",
      "Estee Lauder (EL) and other Club holdings with meaningful exposure to the Chinese economy bounced Friday, following news that BioNTech 's (BNTX) Covid vaccine will soon be available to foreign residents living in China. We're cautiously optimistic about the vaccine development , which adds to hopes that Beijing will soften its restrictive pandemic policies after years of regular virus testing, limits on travel and rolling lockdowns that have weighed on the world's second-largest economy. A former Chinese public health official also suggested that \"substantive\" changes to the government's so-called zero Covid policy could take place in the coming months, according to Reuters . To be sure, it's important to remain measured, and we always take speculation out of China with a grain of salt. After all, Chinese officials have not announced an official transition away from their very strict Covid policy. Friday's vaccine news is narrow in scope: The mRNA Covid shot made by Germany's BioNTech and U.S.-based Pfizer (PFE) will only be available to expatriates who live in China. Nevertheless, the moves in certain stocks tied to China — including many owned by the Club — show the market is taking the vaccine policy change in stride. Estee Lauder shares surged more than 7% to around $208 apiece. The cosmetics giant has a big China business and just a few days ago it cut its sales guidance partly due to China's Covid policy. Shares of Starbucks (SBUX), which counts China as its second-largest market outside the U.S., jumped about 7%. Strong quarterly results released Thursday evening are likely helping the stock, too. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) shares rose nearly 4%. The casino operator has two important properties in the gaming hub of Macao, which is a Chinese special administrative region. Crude prices bounced about 4% on Friday, likely due to the China news because a more complete economic reopening in the country would spur oil demand. The price move provided some support for oil stocks in Friday's volatile stock market. Details on the vaccine news Speaking in China on Friday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Beijing would make BioNTech's Covid vaccine available to foreigners in the country. It would mark the first time that China allowed a vaccine that was not developed domestically to be administered within its borders. BioNTech is a Germany company, and its mRNA-based vaccine — developed alongside Pfizer — is generally seen as being more effective than the vaccines made by Chinese firms. It's not immediately clear when expatriates in China could actually start getting a shot of the BioNTech-Pfizer Covid vaccine. While its availability is limited to a certain cohort for now, Scholz reportedly advocated for broader accessibility in the country. \"Of course, this can only be a first step. I hope that the circle of eligible persons can soon be widened to a general free ability of the BioNTech vaccine,\" Scholz said Friday, according to Reuters. What it means for the Club Will Chinese President Xi Jinping and other communist party leaders heed Scholz's plea? Nobody can say for sure. That's why we stress the importance of interpreting this news in a measured way. But, as we've suggested before, we don't think the Chinese government can maintain its restrictive pandemic approach forever. Its economy has shown weaker growth than recent history , and we think eventually Beijing will moderate its public-health stance in a way that benefits companies operating there. Since we cannot predict for sure when that would occur, we've been patient with names like Wynn Resorts — trimming our position to just a 0.5% weighting but still holding on to some shares on the hope that China would materially reopen. Similarly, we wanted to get back into Estee Lauder before there was an official announcement that China was ending zero-Covid. We saw enough progress on that front to restart our EL position in late September , and Friday's vaccine developments join the list. On Starbucks, the coffee chain continues to invest heavily in China and open new stores in the market, betting on its long-term viability as a growth engine . We understand management's big-picture view, and we were willing to take a stake in the company in late August with a recognition we'd need to be patient around China. \"We anticipate the current Covid-related uncertainty to continue and repeat the view we shared on our Q3 call and our Investor Day that while our long-term aspirations for China remain undiminished, we expect the recovery of our business in the country to be nonlinear,\" Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz said on the company's earnings call Thursday night. A number of other Club stocks, such as Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG), have sizable China businesses that stand to benefit from a relaxation of Covid policies insofar as that boosts the economy. For example, P & G said last month it's still being hurt by lockdowns in China and a general lack of consumer confidence. \"We had certainly hoped for that to ease, but we still see significant negative impact on consumer mobility from the continued strict Covid policies,\" P & G's finance chief, Andre Schulten, said on the company's first-quarter earnings call . \"We feel well positioned – once we see consumer mobility return, we feel very strongly about our ability to grow in the market,\" the CFO added. QCOM and PG shares rose Friday. But AAPL did not see any immediate benefit from the China news. (Apple has been mired in the malaise surrounding Big Tech. The stock, including Friday, was on a five-session losing streak since last Friday's pop, the day after solid earnings .) (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long PG, EL, WYNN, AAPL, QCOM.

      "Linde's potential delisting from Germany's biggest stock exchange matters for shareholders like us\n",
      "Industrial gas giant Linde (LIN) announced plans last week to delist from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange —an unusual move but one we think is in the best interest of shareholders long term. The Club holding is currently listed on two different stock exchanges: the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. and Germany's Frankfurt Stock Exchange. These are set up as full listings, meaning the stock trades in two different currencies, is overseen by two different exchange regulators, is a member of two different index pools and must follow two different reporting requirements — U.S. GAAP in the United States and IFRS in Germany. Dual-listings are not uncommon. Other examples include Unilever (UL) and Alibaba (BABA). A year ago Linde formed a project team with internal and external experts to evaluate whether this structure is in the best interest of shareholders. After what management described as \"thorough and balanced analysis,\" the company concluded that a single stock listing in the United States could expand Linde's valuation , benefitting current shareholders. Linde expects to file a proxy potentially as soon as late November. A shareholder meeting could then be held sometime in mid-February, with the transaction potentially closing in early March, if the measure is approved. Bottom line We believe the rationale behind this decision makes a lot of sense for long-term-oriented shareholders like ourselves. Amid a year of market volatility, we've often seen Linde's stock down heavily in early pre-market trading due to a carry over effect from the European markets and poor sentiment in Germany, a result of Russia's war in Ukraine, rising energy prices, and the strong U.S. dollar. But those stock moves belie Linde's actual fundamental performance, which has proven much stronger than anticipated. Linde's adjusted earnings-per-share range for 2022 was initially set in February at $11.55 to $11.85 a share, but just last week management raised range for the third time this year, to $11.93 to $12.03 share. If there is a pullback related to so-called forced selling in the near-term or closer to the transaction date (if approved), we would treat those declines opportunistically and view it as a buying opportunity. Long-term valuation upside? Unlike in the U.S., several European indices have market capitalization-based limits, designating the maximum percentage any one company can represent on a particular index. If a company exceeds the limit, its stock must be sold during the rebalancing period. The main stock index in Germany is the DAX, roughly equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The DAX is a market-weighted index consisting of the 40 major German blue-chip companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, with a market cap limit of 10%. Additionally, most actively managed mutual fund managers in Europe prohibit any one company stock from comprising more than 10% of a fund. As the company with the largest market cap in the index, Linde's challenge with the 10% limit is that it has become one of the most capped stocks. The company said it spends on average almost two-thirds of each year above the limit since 2020. This means Linde's stock in Germany is often subject to forced technical selling pressure during the index rebalancing period, weighing on the stock regardless of its fundamental merits. Management believes this cap and associated pressure has negatively impacted Linde's valuation, and shares could realize their full potential by delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Lower costs and regulatory requirements From a monetary standpoint, Linde expects productivity savings to be somewhere in the single-digit millions of dollars range, if the delisting goes through. That's immaterial for a company with a market capitalization of about $150 billion, but this decision isn't motivated by cutting costs. It's about reducing complexity. Due to its listing on both U.S. and German exchanges, Linde is required to file full US GAAP and IFRS accounting reports. Maintaining these reports can be expensive, and complex. It also exposes the company to more regulations and risks compared to a single-listed company. Reducing exposure to a single country Linde's large weighting in the DAX often makes its German-listed security trade based on events in Europe. If the DAX sells off due to a weakening economic outlook in Germany or Europe more broadly, shares of Linde will fall along with it. And those early losses often carry over to pre-market trading in the U.S. Linde said it identified this phenomenon through daily trading observations and discussions with investors. But the trading action in Europe is the completely wrong way to approach Linde's stock. Linde is a highly diversified, global company with operations in almost 100 countries. Germany represents just about 5% of total company sales, while revenue from the Americas (United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil) accounts for roughly 42% of sales. By de-listing from the DAX, Linde believes it will no longer trade with sentiment in Germany and will be more appropriately aligned with the S & P 500, of which it represents less than 1 percent. Managing volatility If there is volatility in the stock near the transaction date due to forced selling, we fully expect Linde to be aggressive with its share repurchase program to offset some of the noise. We like Linde's current capital return program. But with its solid cash flow generation and a balance sheet that is better than a single-A credit rating, we think it could be in the company's best interest to do more to quickly clean up any associated volatility from the potential transaction. Given management's strong capital stewardship, we are confident that they will do whatever is best for the company and its shareholders. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long LIN.

      "Companies tout dividend strength on earnings calls. One stock raising payout for 48th straight year\n",
      "Dividends have become increasingly important to investors in the choppy stock market and executives know it, trumpeting their payouts during earnings calls. During a mixed corporate earnings season, executives of companies with stock dividends have used them to emphasize that they value shareholders even in the face of a tough broader economic outlook. Some have also pointed to the longevity or annual growth of their dividends to signal long-term company health in a year defined by challenges for much of corporate America. \"If the board approves a dividend increase, this would be our 48th year of increasing dividends, which I think is a pretty elite group out there,\" said ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez. The data processor beat expectations on per-share earnings and revenue for its first quarter when reporting Oct. 26 . \"I hope this doesn't become an environment where for the next 10 years people are very focused on dividends because that has its own negative implications,\" he said. \"But if you look at over 50 years or 70 years or 100 years, dividends matter, right, and compounding growth of dividends matters a lot.\" 'Dividend aristocrat status' ADP is not the only one looking to separate itself from the pack with its dividend status. Executives at Caterpillar , when reporting beats in its third-quarter earnings call Oct. 27, said the company paid about $600 million in dividends, \"supporting our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis.\" Its stock ended last week up about 15.3%, which was its best weekly performance since July 2009. \"We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status,\" said CEO Jim Umpleby. Others pointed to continued movement toward reaching goals on dividends for the year and beyond in their respective calls. Halliburton executives said when reporting Oct. 25 that the oil field servicer had already returned $1.3 billion of what would likely be a total of $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion in dividends and buybacks put together. The company, which beat expectations for its third-quarter, said it was meeting goals for returning cash to shareholders but now has even \"greater flexibility\" with investor returns given its \"strong\" quarter and outlook. Often discussed in conjunction with dividends, share repurchasing or buybacks happen when a company buys its own shares to take some out of the market, in turn lowering supply. Companies tend to buy their own shares when they have a reserve of cash to do so and see an upside for the stock, so a buyback can signal to investors that executives are willing to bet company money on strong future performance. Consumer goods company Newell Brands , which beat expectations for revenue and earnings per share when reporting Oct. 28, plans to maintain its dividend at \"flat.\" Meanwhile, some touted growth in dividends. Land-and-forest product producer Weyerhaeuser , which beat expectations on per-share earnings and was in-line on revenue when reporting Oct. 27, said it remained on track to grow its dividend by 5% annually through 2025. Biopharmaceutical company AbbVie executives said in its Oct. 28 call they would increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% in February, noting that meant its quarterly cash dividend has grown 270% since the company was founded . The company beat expectations on per-share earnings while missing on revenue. It projected missing expectations on both metrics in the fourth quarter due to headwinds from foreign exchange. 'A high priority' Southwest Airlines is trying to once again be a dividend stock. Restrictions on dividends and share repurchasing from the Payroll Support Program, a federal pandemic support program for airlines, expired at the end of the Southwest's third quarter, according to the airline's Oct. 27 call. The airline beat expectations for per-share earnings and revenue, which hit a company record at $6.22 billion . It is expecting elevated demand to continue through at least the end of 2022 as travel surges coming out of the pandemic, but the airline said unit costs would also be up amid a pilot shortage that is limiting flying. \"Obviously, we want to get back to our long-standing tradition of healthy shareholder returns. And we continue to be thoughtful in our capital allocation decisions,\" said CFO Tammy Romo. \"Clearly, we want to drive future growth and value.\" \"As we look ahead to December, we'll discuss our 2023 plans with you in more detail, but I would just say that our capital allocation priorities really haven't changed,\" she added. \"And as I said earlier, we have a long standing dividend history, so reinstating a dividend continues to be a high priority for us.\"\n",
      "These stocks reporting earnings next week have a track record of beating expectations and trading higher\n",
      "Some companies that have yet to report third-quarter earnings could beat expectations next week, and outperform on the results. Investors are starting to wrap up another earnings season with results that have come in far better than initially feared. About 85.7% of companies in the S & P 500 have reported earnings this season, according to FactSet data. Of the 431 firms that have reported thus far, 71.2% of companies have posted positive surprises. Still, as companies continue to navigate challenges around surging inflation and rising interest rates, CNBC Pro found the names that have historically beat expectations. A review of data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that these companies topped estimates at least 75% of the time, and posted gains of 1% or more on the back of those results. Here are the names. An online gaming company and a solar stock are among the notable names kicking off earnings next week. Activision Blizzard is set to release its earnings report Monday after the bell. The video game company topped earnings earnings per share forecasts 88% of the time, according to Bespoke data. The stock posts an average one-day gain of 1.82%. This week, Wedbush said that shares of Activision Blizzard are at a \"compelling entry point\" if Microsoft's proposed acquisition of the company goes through, as the merger could mean a 10% share of the video game market. The 10% level is notable as it falls below the government target for challenging anti-competitive mergers. Even if the acquisition falls through, Activision Blizzard has a \"robust release slate\" that Wedbush believes will give shareholders a \"level of support.\" The firm has an outperform rating on the company. SolarEdge Technologies will also release third-quarter results Monday. The Israeli company that makes solar inverters posts a positive surprise on per-share earnings estimates 77% of the time. On average, the stock moves 4.86% over a one-day period on the results. In an October note, Goldman Sachs reiterated a buy rating on SolarEdge, saying that it's \"most attractive,\" and that its margin recovery potential is \"underappreciated\" by investors. Cloud revenue management firm Model N is expected to release its latest corporate results on Tuesday. The software company exceeded expectations on earnings per share 97% of the time in prior reports. It posts a 1.29% one-day move on average. D.R. Horton is releasing quarterly results on Wednesday. In the past, the home construction company surpassed earnings expectations 76% of the time, and has raised guidance 13% of the time. D.R. Horton has on average experienced a one-day move of 1.65%. Other stocks include Array Technologies and Ralph Lauren , which are reporting Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.\n",
      "Don't punish your kids if you want them to grow up resilient, child psychologist says. Here's why\n",
      "Mona Delahooke doesn't love the phrase \"gentle parenting.\" Especially because her book, \"Brain-Body Parenting: How to Stop Managing Behavior and Start Raising Joyful, Resilient Kids\" is often lumped into the same category as gentle parenting literature. \"The word 'gentle' is triggering,\" she says. \"That's why I don't use it. People think it means never saying 'no,' but this isn't the case.\" In her book, Delahooke, who is a child psychologist, tackles a more \"granular\" child-rearing method called \"responsive parenting.\" \"The new paradigm is building resilience in human beings,\" she says. \"Relational neuroscience research is clear that what nurtures that [resilience] is responsive parenting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How is responsive parenting different from gentle parenting?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentle parenting is not well-defined,\" Delahooke says. \"It's not defined in the research. It's a very catch-all term.\" All gentle parenting means, she says, is parenting that is less authoritative than what most people associate with \"traditional parenting.\" \"What it really stands for is a parenting style that's different from a generation ago,\" she says. Responsive parenting, though, is something Delahook and others in her field have defined. \"Responsive parenting is about meeting the child where they are and soothing them when their nervous system is in distress,\" she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does responsive parenting work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Delahooke's book challenges the assumption that kids act up for negative attention, to get something they want, or for no reason at all. That assumption, she says, \"leads to consequences\" when you're practicing traditional parenting. \"My approach questions that and says that actually children [behave] well when they can and when they can't there is a reason,\" she says. \"We believe that children want to please their parents.\" A child having a meltdown in a store because they aren't being bought the snack they want is not intending to be ungrateful or difficult. They just haven't developed the emotional tools to deal with being let down. \"They haven't gotten the circuitry of self-regulation built yet,\" she says. \"The ability to accept disappointment and unpredictability and talk yourself down, that's a very long developmental process that most children don't have until they are older.\" And traditional parenting doesn't really consider this. \"Traditional parenting is agnostic of social emotional development,\" she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional parenting is agnostic of social emotional development. Mona Delahooke author and clinical psychologist\n",
      "\n",
      "But actually, a young child or toddler having what Delahooke calls a \"body-up reaction\" is actually quite normal. Ultimately, for example, the child will not be getting the snack. In traditional parenting, though, they are yelled at or are administered a punishment with little acknowledgment of their feelings. \"Not only do you get mad at them, you blame them for being rude or you assign a motive that is negative to a very normal process of a child seeing something at the store and wanting to get it,\" she says. In responsive parenting, you acknowledge how they are feeling and validate that disappointment. \"You have to teach a child to regulate,\" she says. \"You build self-regulation through relationships of safety and trust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Does science support this method?\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaching your child's tantrum with empathy instead of judgment can affect their brain chemistry in a positive way. \"When disappointment is compassionately witnessed and you are emotionally soothing, the child's brain and body stress response is reduced,\" Delahook says. \"An adult's caring presence changes the way a child's body and brain responds to stress. It reduces the stress hormones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How does this help develop a resilient child?\n",

      "Shares of DraftKings closed down 28% on Friday after the sports betting company reported slower monthly customer growth in the third quarter that fell short of estimates.\n",
